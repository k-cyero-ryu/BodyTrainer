Nutrition & Supplement Planning Module ‚Äì PRD
1. Overview
The Nutrition & Supplement Module enables fitness trainers to create, manage, and assign personalized meal plans and supplement schedules for their clients. It integrates USDA FoodData Central to calculate nutritional values automatically and supports both daily and weekly food planning.
Calculate BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)
Your BMR is the amount of energy (calories) your body needs to stay alive at rest ‚Äî basically what you‚Äôd burn lying in bed all day.
Use the Mifflin‚ÄìSt Jeor equation (the most accepted modern one):
üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è For men:
BMR=(10√óweight in kg)+(6.25√óheight in cm)‚àí(5√óage)+5 
üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è For women:
BMR=(10√óweight in kg)+(6.25√óheight in cm)‚àí(5√óage)‚àí161 ________________________________________
‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Multiply by Activity Factor (to get TDEE)
Activity Level	Description	Multiplier
Sedentary	Little or no exercise	1.2
Lightly Active	Light exercise/sports 1‚Äì3 days/week	1.375
Moderately Active	Moderate exercise 3‚Äì5 days/week	1.55
Very Active	Hard exercise 6‚Äì7 days/week	1.725
Extra Active	Very hard physical job or twice-a-day training	1.9
TDEE=BMR√óActivity Factor
